question: 
I have lots of http request in my angular app with backend ip as hardcode
when I build project I  cant change this ip 
how to convert it as changeable ip



answer:
To make the backend IP address configurable in your Angular app so that you can change it easily without rebuilding the project, you can follow these steps:

Create a Configuration File: Start by creating a configuration file where you can store the backend IP address.

Use Angular Environment Variables: Angular allows you to define environment-specific configuration files. You can use these to specify different backend IP addresses for different environments (e.g., development, production).

Inject the Configuration: Inject the configuration into your Angular services or components so that they can use the configured IP address to make HTTP requests.

Here's a step-by-step guide:

Step 1: Create a Configuration File
Create a file named environment.ts in your src/environments directory if it doesn't exist already. This file contains the configuration for your development environment.

typescript
Copy code
// src/environments/environment.ts

export const environment = {
  production: false,
  apiUrl: 'http://your-backend-ip-address:port'
};
For production, create a file named environment.prod.ts in the same directory:

typescript
Copy code
// src/environments/environment.prod.ts

export const environment = {
  production: true,
  apiUrl: 'http://your-backend-ip-address:port'
};
Replace 'http://your-backend-ip-address:port' with the actual IP address and port of your backend server.

Step 2: Inject the Configuration
Inject the configuration in your Angular services or components where you make HTTP requests.

typescript
Copy code
// example.service.ts

import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';
import { environment } from '../environments/environment';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class ExampleService {
  private apiUrl = environment.apiUrl;

  constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}

  getData() {
    return this.http.get(`${this.apiUrl}/api/data`);
  }
}
Step 3: Use the Configuration
Use the configured IP address in your HTTP requests throughout your Angular app. By utilizing the environment object, Angular will automatically select the appropriate IP address based on the environment.

Step 4: Change IP Address
Now, whenever you need to change the backend IP address, you can simply modify the environment.ts or environment.prod.ts file without rebuilding the project.

Note:
Remember to import HttpClientModule in your Angular module and provide any necessary services.

typescript
Copy code
// app.module.ts

import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http';

import { AppComponent } from './app.component';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent
  ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    HttpClientModule
  ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
By following these steps, you can easily manage and change the backend IP address in your Angular app without rebuilding it every time.
